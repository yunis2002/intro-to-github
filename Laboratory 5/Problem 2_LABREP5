# Solmaris Condominium Group has many condos that are available as weekly vacation rentals. 
# Design a database to meet the following requirements:

# a)    For each renter, list his or her number, first name, middle initial, last name, address, city, state, postal code, telephone number, and email address.
# b)    For each property, list the condo location number, condo location name, address, city, state, postal code, condo unit number, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, maximum number of persons that can sleep in the unit, and the base weekly rate.
# c)  	For each rental agreement, list the renter number, first name, middle initial, last name, address, city, state, postal code, telephone number, start date of the rental, end date of the rental, and the weekly rental amount. The rental period is one or more weeks.
