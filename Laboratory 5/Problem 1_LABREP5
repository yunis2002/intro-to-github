Colonial Adventure Tours is considering offering outdoor adventure classes to prepare people to participate in hiking, biking, and paddling adventures. 
Only one class is taught on any given day. 
Participants can enroll in one or more classes. 
Classes are taught by the guides that Colonial Adventure employs. 
Participants do not know who the instructor for a particular class will be until the day of the class. 
Colonial Adventure Tours needs your help with the database design for this new venture. 
In each step, represent your answer using the shorthand representation and a diagram. 
Use crow’s foot notation for the diagram. 
Follow the sample SQLite chinook database ERD (Download it from Blackboard Course Materials)
