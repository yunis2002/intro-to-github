# Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers. 
# The median is the number that would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted. 
# The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. 
# Define these functions in a module named stats.py. 
# Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. 
# Each function expects a list of numbers as an argument and returns a single number.
