Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers. 
The median is the number that would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted. 
The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. 
Define these functions in a module named stats.py. 
Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. 
Each function expects a list of numbers as an argument and returns a single number.

import math
import stats
from collections import Counter

data = [12, 43,23, 55, 765,54, 234, 243, 34,34,34,34,12,12,12 ,546, 100, 465,65, 123, 786]

def MEAN(data):
    n = len(data)
    sum = 0

    for i in data:
        sum = sum + i
        MEAN = sum/n
    return MEAN
    
    def MEDIAN(x):
    data.sort()
    n = len(data)
    midnum = int(n/2)
    
    if(n%2 == 1):
        MEDIAN = data[midnum]
        return MEDIAN
    else:
        MEDIAN = (data[midnum]+data[midnum+1])/2
        return MEDIAN
