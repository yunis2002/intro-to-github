Add three methods to the Student class that compare two Student objects. 
One method should test for equality. A second method should test for less than. 
The third method should test for greater than or equal to. 
In each case, the method returns the result of the comparison of the two students’ names. 
Include a main function that tests all of the comparison operators.
