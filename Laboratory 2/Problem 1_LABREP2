# A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers, as defined in the below sample programs: 

# -mode.py 
# -median.py

# Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. 
# Each function should expect a list of numbers as an argument and return a single number. 
# Each function should return 0 if the list is empty. 
# Include a main function that tests the three statistical functions with a given list.
