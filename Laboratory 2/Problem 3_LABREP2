# Modify the sentence-generator program of Case Study 5.3:
# - METIS book: 9781337671019, page 150
# - Python source code: generator.py

# so that it inputs its vocabulary from a set of text files at startup. 
# The filenames are nouns.txt, verbs. txt, articles.txt, and prepositions.txt. 

# (Hint: Define a single new function, getWords. This function should expect a filename as an argument. 
# The function should open an input file with this name, define a temporary list, read words from the file, and add them to the list. 
# The function should then convert the list to a tuple and return this tuple. 
# Call the function with an actual filename to initialize each of the four variables for the vocabulary.)
